# Spike Battleship

## Introduction

Inspired by the minimalistic style of [A Dark Room], I have spiked my own version of minimalistic game - Battleship. This is one of my first attempt to combine object oriented design with command line interface gaming. Although it is not test driven and containing bugs, it is a good demostration of what could be achieved within a timeframe of few hours.

ruby run.rb

Enjoy the texture of command line interface gaming!
